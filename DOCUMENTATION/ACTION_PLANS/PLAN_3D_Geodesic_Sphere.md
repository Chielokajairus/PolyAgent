# 3D Geodesic Sphere Implementation - Execution Plan

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Transform the current 2D SVG geodesic sphere into a true 3D interactive element using Three.js, creating a professional embossed/debossed appearance that matches the logo reference.

## MILESTONE 1: Dependencies & Setup
**Objective:** Install and configure Three.js and related dependencies

### Tasks:
- [x] Install Three.js and TypeScript types
- [x] Install @types/three for TypeScript support
- [x] Configure Vite for Three.js optimization
- [x] Set up basic Three.js scene structure
- [x] Test basic 3D rendering

**Dependencies Required:**
```json
{
  "three": "^0.160.0",
  "@types/three": "^0.160.0"
}
```

**Test Criteria:** Basic 3D scene renders without errors

## MILESTONE 2: Geodesic Geometry Creation
**Objective:** Build proper icosahedron-based geodesic sphere geometry

### Tasks:
- [x] Create icosahedron base geometry
- [x] Implement geodesic subdivision algorithm
- [x] Generate proper vertex and face data
- [x] Create wireframe material with custom shaders
- [x] Add node/vertex highlighting

**Technical Requirements:**
- Icosahedron base (20 triangular faces)
- Geodesic subdivision (frequency 2-3)
- Proper UV mapping for materials
- Vertex normals for lighting

**Test Criteria:** 3D sphere displays with correct geometry

## MILESTONE 3: Material & Lighting System
**Objective:** Create embossed/debossed appearance with professional lighting

### Tasks:
- [x] Design custom shader materials
- [x] Implement embossed/dedebossed effect
- [x] Add ambient and directional lighting
- [x] Create subtle shadow system
- [x] Implement depth-based opacity

**Visual Effects:**
- Embossed wireframe lines
- Debossed surface texture
- Subtle ambient occlusion
- Professional lighting setup

**Test Criteria:** Sphere has realistic embossed appearance

## MILESTONE 4: Animation & Interaction
**Objective:** Add smooth 3D animations and user interactions

### Tasks:
- [x] Implement smooth rotation animation
- [x] Add hover interaction effects
- [x] Create node pulse animations
- [x] Add mouse/touch interaction
- [x] Optimize performance for 60fps

**Animation Features:**
- Continuous gentle rotation
- Hover-triggered node highlights
- Smooth camera transitions
- Responsive interaction

**Test Criteria:** Animations run smoothly at 60fps

## MILESTONE 5: Integration & Polish
**Objective:** Integrate 3D sphere into existing Hero component

### Tasks:
- [x] Replace SVG with Three.js canvas
- [x] Match existing layout and sizing
- [x] Add responsive canvas scaling
- [x] Optimize for mobile performance
- [x] Add loading states and fallbacks

**Integration Requirements:**
- Responsive design compatibility
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility considerations
- Fallback for older browsers

**Test Criteria:** 3D sphere integrates seamlessly with existing design

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Geodesic Sphere Parameters:
- **Base Shape:** Icosahedron (20 faces)
- **Subdivision Frequency:** 2-3 (for optimal detail)
- **Wireframe Thickness:** 0.5-1px equivalent
- **Node Size:** 2-3px equivalent
- **Animation Speed:** 0.5-1 RPM rotation

### Performance Targets:
- **Frame Rate:** 60fps minimum
- **Initial Load:** <2 seconds
- **Memory Usage:** <50MB
- **Mobile Performance:** 30fps minimum

### Browser Support:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## DEPENDENCIES BREAKDOWN

### Core Dependencies:
```bash
npm install three @types/three
```

### Optional Enhancements:
```bash
npm install gsap  # For advanced animations
```

### Development Dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/three
```

## RISK MITIGATION

### Performance Risks:
- **Issue:** Complex geometry causing low frame rates
- **Solution:** Implement LOD (Level of Detail) system
- **Fallback:** Reduce subdivision frequency

### Browser Compatibility:
- **Issue:** WebGL not supported
- **Solution:** SVG fallback for older browsers
- **Detection:** WebGL capability detection

### Mobile Performance:
- **Issue:** Poor performance on mobile devices
- **Solution:** Adaptive quality settings
- **Fallback:** Simplified geometry for mobile

## SUCCESS METRICS
- 3D sphere renders correctly in all target browsers
- Smooth 60fps animation on desktop
- Professional embossed/debossed appearance
- Responsive interaction and hover effects
- Seamless integration with existing design

## IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS
1. Install Three.js dependencies
2. Create basic 3D scene setup
3. Implement icosahedron geometry
4. Test basic rendering
